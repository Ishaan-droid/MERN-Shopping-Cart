# MERN-Shopping-Cart

Welcome to the MERN shopping cart. It is build with MERN stack along with redux for global state management.
This app does not focus on styling but has immense number of functionalties and is completely responsive as
well.

# Functionalities

I have all created all the rest API with the help of node js and used mongodb for managing the data. There is user authentication and authorization as well. Moreover there is no spam registration and only verfied emails can create account. User has to verify mail with the help of OTP send to their mail.

I have used JWT token to protect the routes and http cookies to store them. The api also filters data depending on the category and price. This is done at backend only and not with React. ðŸ”¥

# Scope

This app still has many feature to be implemented. Registration process is implemented for backend but needs to be implemented at front end. I need to add a profile page where user can store his address and other personal details. A payment gateway also needs to be setup. Other than this there are many other functionalities which can be added. This is an open source project and can be used by any one.
